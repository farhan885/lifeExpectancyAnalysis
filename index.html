      <h3> About the Dataset </h3>
      <p>
          The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO)
keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The
datasets are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The dataset related
to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data
repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation
website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen
which are more representative. It has been observed that in the past 15 years, there has been a
huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially
in the developing nations in comparison to the past 30 years. Therefore, in this project we have
considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis. The individual data
files have been merged into a single dataset. 
      </p>
      <h3> What to do? </h3>
      <p>
                To visualizing 193 Countries life expectancy by comparing with different available factors i.e.,
        Year, status (developing or developed country), age, alcohol, Hepatitis B, Measles, Adult
        Mortality etc. 
      </p>
      <h3> Why? </h3>
      <p>
            Life Expectancy is a measure that is often used to measure the overall health of a community. It
            tells us the average age of death in a population. So, by visualizing the life expectancy country
            wise we can have some idea about which countries life expectancy is less and which countries
            life expectancy is high and what factors are affecting them so that those factors can be studied
            further and make them better. 
      </p>

      <h1> How? </h1>
      <h3> Approach:</h3>
      <p>
            - We have used WHO dataset available on KAGGLE.<br>
            - Below we have used different types of graphs to visualize the data:
      </p>

      <h3>Scatter Plot</h3>
      <p>Below is the basic visualization of the Life Expectancy of each country with the scatter plot.</p>
